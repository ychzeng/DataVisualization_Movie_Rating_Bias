# DataVisualization_Movie_Rating_Bias
## Introduction
If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated? In this Project, I will examine whether Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets
